## Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics & Statistics, UNSW Sydney. I am 
supervised by [Zdravko Botev](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~zdravkobotev/) and [Sarat Moka](https://saratmoka.com/).  

My research centres on sparse statistical learning in high-dimensional settings, with my PhD work focusing on the development and optimisation of penalised methods. I have recently designed fast, scalable algorithms for \(\ell_{1}\)-constrained models using majorisation--minimisation techniques and for non-convex \(\ell_{0}\)-constrained formulations via continuous optimisation. Beyond these topics, I am interested in numerical linear algebra, particularly randomized methods for estimating large matrix functions and computations.

### Education
