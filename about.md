## Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics & Statistics, UNSW Sydney. I am 
supervised by [Zdravko Botev](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~zdravkobotev/) and [Sarat Moka](https://saratmoka.com/).  

My research centres on sparse statistical learning in high-dimensional settings, with my PhD focusing on the development and optimisation of penalised methods. I have recently developed fast, scalable algorithms for convex \(\ell_{1}\)-constrained models via majorisation–minimisation and for non-convex \(\ell_{0}\)-constrained formulations through continuous optimisation. I have also reseearched in numerical linear algebra—particularly randomized algorithms for estimating large matrix computations. More broadly, I am interested in problem found in high-dimensional statistics and model compression.

### Education
