## Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics & Statistics, UNSW Sydney. I am 
supervised by [Zdravko Botev](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~zdravkobotev/) and [Sarat Moka](https://saratmoka.com/).  

My research focuses on sparse statistical learning in high-dimensional settings, with my PhD work centred on the development and optimisation of penalised methods. I have recently developed fast, scalable algorithms for convex ℓ₁-constrained models using majorisation–minimisation techniques and for non-convex ℓ₀-constrained formulations through continuous optimisation. I have also conducted research in numerical linear algebra, particularly on randomized algorithms for estimating large matrix computations. More broadly, I am interested in problems arising in high-dimensional statistics and model compression.
