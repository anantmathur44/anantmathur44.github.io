## Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics & Statistics, UNSW Sydney. I am 
supervised by [Zdravko Botev](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~zdravkobotev/) and [Sarat Moka](https://saratmoka.com/).  

 My research focuses on sparse statistical learning in high-dimensional settings. My PhD has centred on developing optimisation methods for sparse statistical models, including scalable algorithms for convex \(\ell_1\)-constrained problems using majorisation–minimisation techniques and for non-convex \(\ell_0\)-constrained problems via binary relaxation methods. More broadly, I am interested in challenges arising in high-dimensional statistics and model compression.

### Education
* **PhD (Statistics)** — UNSW Sydney, 2020‑2025 (expected)  
* **BSc (Hons). (Statistics)** —  UNSW Sydney, 2015‑2019
