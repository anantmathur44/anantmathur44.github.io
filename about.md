## Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics & Statistics, UNSW Sydney. I am 
supervised by [Zdravko Botev](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~zdravkobotev/) and [Sarat Moka](https://saratmoka.com/).  

My research focuses on high-dimensional statistics, penalized regression, and optimization for sparse statistical learning. Some of my recent work developing fast and scalable algorithms for both convex (\(\ell_1\)) using majorization-minimziation (MM) algorithms and non-convex (\(\ell_0\)) penalized models, and I explore Monte Carlo methods for efficiently estimating the large-scale matrix quantities that arise in these settings.

### Education
* **PhD (Statistics)** — UNSW Sydney, 2020‑2025 (expected)  
* **BSc (Hons). (Statistics)** —  UNSW Sydney, 2015‑2019 (expected)
